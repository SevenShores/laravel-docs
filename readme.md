# Laravel Docs - Extended Edition

I have many times come across a problem I need to solve and the [official docs](https://github.com/laravel/docs) don't address the issue so I have to dig and search and eventually find out something that is a totally simple solution, solved by the framework and that I wish were explained or had an example in the docs.

It appears that [Taylor wants to keep the docs simple](https://github.com/laravel/docs/pull/1769#issuecomment-135811143), I guess to not confuse beginners, or whatever reason. So I've decided to make my life and maybe others' easier, who want more than simplified documentation and would like more examples by creating this repo/site.

I will add to this every time I run across something like this and I hope you will too.

Cheers.
